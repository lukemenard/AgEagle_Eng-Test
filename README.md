# Eng-Test

Thank you for participating in the ageagle engineering test. We would like you to build an application that has the following features:

API: 
* Create a REST api that returns a number of random lat and long points with weather data. 
* The consuymer of the api should be able to specifty the number of returned points
* Weather data can be pulled via an api from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/current) 
* Random numbers should be retreived from an outside source ie: [Random.org api](https://www.random.org/clients/http/)

Webapp: 
* Create a webapp that consumes the api that you created and displays the data.

Notes:

* Do this test in what ever language and way you feel comfortable in. Ideally the UI portion is a webapp of some form
* Use this test as a showcase of good development practices
* Please include instructions on how to run your application as a part of submitting

Helpful Hints:

* [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/overview/) is a great tool to use  for rendering maps
* Dont forget there are only certian valid numbers for a lat / long 

Submitting:

* Email careers@ageagle.com with either a zip of your project, or a link to a public git repositry
* A git repo is the prefferred method
